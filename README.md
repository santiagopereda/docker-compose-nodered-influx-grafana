This repository contains a sample Docker Compose configuration for setting up a local development environment with Node-Red, InfluxDB_v2, Telegraf, Chronograf, and Grafana. It simplifies the process of deploying and running these services together, allowing you to quickly get started with data collection, storage, visualization, and workflow automation.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following installed on your machine:

- Docker: [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- Docker Compose: [Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Getting Started

To get started with the Docker Compose configuration, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the repository's directory.

## Configuration

The configuration of this Docker Compose setup is defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file. You can modify this file to adjust various parameters such as service ports, volumes, environment variables, and more.

## Usage

To start the services defined in the Docker Compose configuration, run the following command:

```shell
docker-compose up -d
```

This command will download the necessary Docker images, create and start the containers in detached mode (`-d` flag). It may take a while for the initial setup, as it needs to fetch the required images from Docker Hub.

To stop and remove the containers, use the following command:

```shell
docker-compose down
```

## Accessing Services

Once the containers are up and running, you can access the following services:

- **Node-Red**: Access Node-Red at [http://localhost:1880](http://localhost:1880)
- **InfluxDB_v2**: Access InfluxDB at [http://localhost:8086](http://localhost:8086)
- **Chronograf**: Access Chronograf at [http://localhost:8087](http://localhost:8087)
- **Grafana**: Access Grafana at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Customization

You can customize this Docker Compose configuration to fit your specific needs. Feel free to modify the `docker-compose.yml` file and adjust service settings, volumes, environment variables, or add additional services as required.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you find any issues or have suggestions for improvements, please open an issue or submit a pull request.

## Containers

This Docker Compose configuration includes the following containers:
